            <p>This project displays alternating candy hearts with random valentine's themed messages and colors on a TTGO T-Display ESP32. The display was embedded in an envelope and suspended from the ceiling on the Barnard College Milstein Library 5th floor CSC Lounge on 2/13/2024.</p>

            <h4 style="font-weight:bold">Artistic vision</h4>
            I wanted to capture the spirit of Valentine's Day with this project, and candy hearts are a quintessential symbol of Valentine's Day.
            I chose to randomly generate the messages and colors to invoke the generative aspect of this assignment.
            The heart displays every 5 seconds, then the display goes into deep sleep mode to conserve energy for 5 seconds, and then the screen turns back on with a different randomly generated heart.
            For practical reasons, I chose to allow the user to display the battery life of the device by pressing the green battery button in the bottom-left corner.
            I wanted this project to be bright, but also clear and not too busy so that it was inviting, but not overwhelming to the viewer.
            <br><br>
            <h4 style="font-weight:bold">Technical challenges</h4>
            The biggest technical challenge was changing the display little by little until it looked exactly how I wanted it.
            This meant adjusting and readjusting position of the shapes that made up the heart, the background heart, and the text over and over again.
            Every little change required a re-compile and re-upload to the board.
            I also had to figure out how to make the display go to sleep and wake up again via button press.
            I consulted the TTGO T-Display documentation to figure out the right pin to use for the battery button, and on what signal to detect the button press.
